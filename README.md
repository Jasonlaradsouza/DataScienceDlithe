# DataScienceProject
This repository contains the projects related to data science.
1. Fish Market: Here we use Dataset of common fish species for fish market to predict the weight of the fish.
2. GPU Kernal Performance : Here we use GPU Kernal Performance Dataset to predict GPU runtime;
3. Car Details: Here we use Vehichle Dataset to predict the sell price of the car.
4. New York Stock Exchange: Here we use S&P 500 Companies historical prices with fundamental data to predict the Total Revenue.
5. California Housing: Here we use California Housing Dataset to predict the median housing value.
# Conclusion
All these ML models are implemented using Linear Regression Algorithm.
1. Fish Market: We predicted the weight of the fish and we found the R2 score to be 0.885.
2. GPU Kernel Performance: We predicted the GPU runtime and we found the R2 score to be 0.40.
3. Car details: We predicted the sell price of the car and we found the R2 score to be 0.18.
4. New York Stock Exchange: We predicted the total revenue and we found the R2 score to be 0.75.
5. California Housing: We predicted the median house value and we found the R2 score to be 0.63.
